<align>Shareholders who intentionally or gross negligently leave a person who may not act as director to manage the company’s business shall be held jointly and severally liable to the company for that damage which arises on account of the fact that this person violates the obligations which he is under vis-a-vis the company.</align>

<align>An application to enter the company in the Commercial Register must be filed with that court in whose district the company has its registered office.</align>
<align>The application for registration may be made only after one quarter of the nominal value of each share has been deposited, unless contributions in kind have been agreed.</align>
<align>In total, at least as much of the share capital must have been deposited so that the total amount of the contributions in cash paid in, plus the total nominal capital of the shares for which contributions in kind are to be paid, equals half of the minimum share capital pursuant to section 5 (1).</align>
<align>The contributions in kind shall be effected to the company, before the application for entry in the Commercial Register is filed, in such a manner that they are finally at the free disposal of the directors.</align>
<align>Section 8 Content of application for registration</align>
<align>The following must be enclosed with the application for registration:</align>
<align>The articles of association and, in the case referred to in section 2 (2), the powers of attorney of those representatives who have signed the articles of association, or a certified copy of these documents,</align>
<align>The directors’ legitimation, unless their appointment has been laid down in the articles of association,</align>
<align>A list of shareholders which meets the requirements laid down in section 40 and has been signed by those applying for registration,</align>

<align>If contributions in kind have been agreed, the documents certifying that the value of the contributions in kind equals the nominal value of the shares subscribed to thereby.</align>
<align>(repealed)</align>
<align>The application for registration must include the assurance that the payments against the shares referred to in section 7 (2) and (3) have been effected and that the object of the payments is finally at the free disposal of the directors.</align>
<align>The court may require proof (for instance deposit slips) where there is considerable doubt as to the correctness of the assurance.</align>
<align>The directors must give their assurance in the application for registration that there are no circumstances which preclude their appointment in accordance with section 6 (2), second sentence, nos 2 and 3, and the third sentence, and that they have been instructed about their unlimited duty to disclose information to the court.</align>
<align>The instruction referred to in section 53 (2) of the Federal Central Criminal Register Act may be given in writing; it may also be given by a notary or a notary appointed abroad, by a representative of a comparable legal advisory profession or a consular official.</align>

<align>Other claims shall remain unaffected.</align>
<align>The company’s claim under subsection (1), first sentence, shall become statute-barred ten years after the company is entered in the Commercial Register. Section 9a</align>
<align>Claims for compensation on part of company</align>
<align>Where false statements are made for the purpose of forming the company, the shareholders and directors of the company, as joint and several debtors, shall make the payments which have not been made, they shall compensate for remuneration which has not been included in the expenses for formation, and they shall pay compensation for any other damage arising.</align>
<align>Where the company suffers damage due to an intentional or grossly negligent act by shareholders on account of capital contributions or expenses for formation, the shareholders shall all be liable to compensate that damage as joint and several debtors.</align>
<align>A shareholder or director shall be exempt from these obligations if he was neither aware of the facts establishing the obligation to pay compensation nor needed to be aware thereof when applying the due care of a prudent businessman.</align>
<align>In addition to the shareholders, those persons for whose account the shareholders have subscribed to shares shall also be responsible in the same manner.</align>
<align>They may not rely on their own ignorance on account of such circumstances of which a shareholder acting for their account was aware or of which he needed to be aware when applying the due care of a prudent businessman.</align>
<align>Section 9b Waiver of claims for compensation</align>
<align>The company’s waiver of claims for compensation under section 9a or the company’s settlement in regard to such claims shall be ineffective in so far as the compensation is necessary to satisfy the company’s creditors.</align>
<align>This shall not apply where the person obligated to pay compensation is insolvent and reaches a settlement with his creditors to avert the insolvency proceedings or if the obligation to pay compensation has been regulated in an insolvency plan.</align>
<align>The company’s claims for compensation under section 9a shall become statute-barred after five years.</align>
<align>The period of limitation begins to run when the company is entered in the Commercial Register or, if the act creating the obligation to pay compensation was committed at a later point in time, upon performance of that act.</align>
<align>Section 9c Refusal to register company</align>
<align>If the company has not been properly formed and registered, the court shall refuse to make the entry in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>This shall also apply where contributions in kind have been over-valued to a not insignificant degree.</align>
<align>The court may refuse to make the entry in accordance with subsection (1) only on account of a defective or void provision or in the absence of a provision in the articles of association in so far as that provision, its absence or its nullity</align>
<align>concerns facts or legal relations which must be specified in the articles of association in accordance with section 3 (1) or on account of other mandatory statutory provisions, or which must be entered in the Commercial Register or must be publicly noticed by the court,</align>
<align>violate provisions which exclusively or predominantly exist to protect the company’s creditors or which are otherwise in the public interest, or</align>
<align>result in the articles of association becoming null and void.</align>

<align>The nature of the directors’ powers of representation must also be entered.</align>
<align>If the articles of association contain provisions on the term of the company or on the authorised capital, these determinations must also be included in the entry.</align>
<align>If a person authorised to take receipt of declarations of intent and deliveries to the company is registered for entry in the Commercial Register with a domestic address, this information must also be entered; this authorisation shall continue to apply vis-a-vis third parties until such time as it is deleted from the Commercial Register and the deletion has been made known, unless the lack of authorisation was known to the third party.</align>
<align>(repealed)</align>
<align>Section 11 Legal status prior to entry</align>
<align>A limited liability company shall not exist as such until the company has been entered in the Commercial Register at the place of its registered office.</align>
<align>Where acts are performed in the company’s name before the entry is made, the persons acting shall be personally as well as jointly and severally liable.</align>
<align>Section 12 Company announcements</align>
<align>Wherever the law or the articles of association provide that matters concerning the company must be announced, such announcement shall be effected by publication in the Federal Gazette (company’s designated publication).</align>
<align>The articles of association may designate further public gazettes or electronic information media as the company’s designated publications.</align>
<align>Part 2</align>
<align>Legal relations of company and shareholders</align>
<align>Section 13 Legal person; commercial company</align>
<align>A limited liability company as such has independent rights and obligations; it may acquire ownership of and other rights in real property, and may sue and be sued in court.</align>
<align>The company assets alone shall serve to discharge the company’s obligations vis-a-vis its creditors.</align>
<align>The company is deemed to be a commercial company within the meaning of the Commercial Code.</align>
<align>Section 14 Obligation to pay capital contribution</align>
<align>A capital contribution shall be paid for each share.</align>
<align>The amount of the capital contribution to be paid is determined on the basis of the nominal value of the share as stipulated in the articles of association upon the formation of the company.</align>
<align>In the event of a capital increase, the amount of the capital contribution to be paid is determined on the basis of the nominal value of the share as set out in the declaration of subscription.</align>
<align>Section 15 Transfer of shares</align>
<align>Shares shall be alienable and inheritable.</align>
<align>If a shareholder purchases further shares in addition to his original share, these shall remain legally independent.</align>
<align>An agreement concluded in notarial form shall be required for the transfer of shares by shareholders.</align>
<align>An agreement establishing the shareholder’s obligation to transfer a share shall likewise require notarial form.</align>
<align>However, an agreement concluded without such notarial form shall become valid once the transfer agreement is concluded pursuant to subsection (3).</align>
<align>The articles of association may stipulate that the transfer of shares be made dependent on further conditions, in particular the company’s consent.</align>
<align>Section 16 Legal status following change in shareholders or extent of participation; purchase from non-authorised persons</align>
<align>In the event of a change in the person of a shareholder or the extent of his participation, the owner, in relation to the company, of a share shall be deemed to be only whoever has been included as such in the list of shareholders entered in the Commercial Register (section 40).</align>
<align>A legal act performed by the transferee in relation to the company shall be deemed effective from the beginning if the list is entered in the Commercial Register without undue delay after performance of the legal act.</align>
<align>The transferee as well as the transferor shall be held liable in respect of obligations to pay capital contributions which are overdue at the point in time from which the transferee is deemed, in relation to the company, to be the owner of the share pursuant to subsection (1), first sentence.</align>
<align>The transferee may effectively acquire a share or a right in a share from a non-authorised person by legal transaction if the transferor has been named as the owner of the share in the list of shareholders entered in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>This shall not apply if, at the time of the purchase, the list was incorrect in respect of the share for no more than three years and the incorrectness cannot be attributed to the person entitled.</align>
<align>Further, a purchase in good faith cannot be made if the transferee is aware of the lack of authorisation or is unaware of the lack of authorisation as a consequence of gross negligence or if an objection to the list has been entered.</align>
<align>The objection is entered on the basis of an interim order or on the basis of the approval of that person against whose authorisation the objection has been raised.</align>
<align>A threat to the right of the person raising the objection need not be substantiated.</align>
<align>Section 17 (repealed)</align>
<align>Section 18 Joint ownership of share</align>
<align>If several joint owners are entitled to one undivided share, they may exercise the rights arising from that share only jointly.</align>
<align>They shall be jointly and severally liable vis-a-vis the company for the payments to be effected against the share.</align>
<align>Legal acts which the company must perform vis-a-vis the owner of the share shall, in so far as there is no joint representative for the joint owners, also be effective if they are only performed vis-a-vis one of the joint owners.</align>
<align>This provision shall apply to several inheritors of a shareholder only in regard to legal acts performed after one month has elapsed since the devolution of the inheritance.</align>
<align>Section 19 Payment of capital contributions</align>
<align>Payment of capital contributions in respect of the shares shall be made in proportion to the contributions in cash.</align>
<align>The shareholders may not be exempt from the obligation to pay the capital contributions.</align>
<align>A payment may be offset against the company’s claim only in the form of a claim arising from the transfer of assets whose crediting against the obligation to pay capital contributions has been agreed in accordance with section 5 (4), first sentence.</align>
<align>No right of retention may be asserted against the object of a contribution in kind on the basis of claims which do not refer to the object.</align>
<align>The shareholders may be exempt from the obligation to pay capital contributions on the basis of a capital reduction at most in the amount of that contribution by which the share capital has been reduced.</align>
<align>If, upon economic consideration and on the basis of an agreement reached in connection with the taking over of a contribution in cash, a contribution in cash made by a shareholder is to be regarded either fully or partly as a contribution in kind (hidden contribution in kind), this does not exempt the shareholder from the obligation to pay a capital contribution.</align>
<align>However, the agreements concerning the contribution in kind and the legal acts performed to execute them shall not be ineffective.</align>
<align>The value of the asset at the point in time at which the company files the application for entry in the Commercial Register or the point in time of its assignment to the company, if this is a later point in time, shall be credited against the shareholder’s continuing obligation to pay a contribution in cash.</align>
<align>The crediting shall not be effected before the company is entered in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>The burden of proof regarding the intrinsic value of the assets shall be on the shareholder.</align>
<align>If a payment to the shareholder has been agreed prior to the capital contribution which corresponds, in economic terms, to a repayment of the capital contribution and this is not to be regarded as a hidden contribution in kind within the meaning of subsection (4), this exempts the shareholder from his obligation to pay a capital contribution only if the payment is covered by the full right of return which is due at any time or can fall due on account of termination without notice by the company.</align>
<align>Reference to such payment or the agreement to make such payment shall be included in the application for registration made in accordance with section 8.</align>
<align>The company’s claim to payment of the contributions shall become statute-barred ten years after the claim arises.</align>
<align>If insolvency proceedings are opened against the company’s assets, the period of limitation shall not end until six months have elapsed since the insolvency proceedings were opened.</align>
<align>Section 20 Default interest</align>
<align>A shareholder who does not pay the amount called in on the original capital share as and when it is due shall be obligated to pay default interest by operation of law.</align>
<align>Section 21 Forfeiture</align>
<align>In the event of delayed payment, the defaulting shareholder may be issued with a renewed request to make the payment within a specified grace period under penalty of his exclusion along with the share for which the payment is to be made.</align>
<align>The request shall be made by registered letter.</align>
<align>The grace period must be no less than one month.</align>
<align>After fruitless expiry of this period the defaulting shareholder shall be declared to have forfeited his share and any partial payments made to the company.</align>
<align>The declaration shall be made by registered letter.</align>
<align>A shareholder who has been excluded shall remain liable for any loss the company incurs on account of the defaulted amount or the amounts of the original capital share called in against the share at a later point in time.</align>
<align>Section 22 Liability of legal predecessors</align>
<align>The last and each previous legal predecessor of an excluded shareholder who is deemed to be the owner, in relation to the company, of the share shall also be held liable for any unfulfilled obligation to pay capital contributions on the part of an excluded shareholder.</align>
<align>An earlier legal predecessor shall be held liable only in so far as the payment cannot be redeemed from his legal successor; this is to be assumed to be the case until the opposite is proven if the latter has not made the payment by the end of one month after the request for payment having been sent to him and notification thereof having been sent to the legal predecessor.</align>
<align>The legal predecessor’s liability shall be limited to payments called in within a period of five years on the basis of the obligation to pay capital contributions.</align>
<align>The period begins to run on that day from which the legal successor is to be regarded as the owner of the share in the company.</align>
<align>The legal predecessor acquires the excluded shareholder’s share against payment of the outstanding amount.</align>
<align>Section 23 Auction of share</align>
<align>If payment of the outstanding amount cannot be collected from any legal predecessors, the company may have the share sold by way of public auction.</align>
<align>Any other form of sale shall be permissible only with the consent of the excluded shareholder.</align>
<align>Section 24 Raising shortfalls</align>
<align>Where an original capital share can neither be collected from the person obligated to pay it nor covered by the sale of the share, the remaining shareholders must raise the shortfall in proportion to their shares.</align>
<align>Amounts which cannot be collected from individual shareholders shall be distributed in the aforementioned proportion amongst the remaining shareholders.</align>
<align>Section 25 Mandatory provisions</align>
<align>The shareholders may not be exempt from the legal consequences set out in sections 21 to 24.</align>
<align>Section 26 Obligation to pay additional contributions</align>
<align>The articles of association may determine that, in addition to the nominal values of the shares, the shareholders may take decisions to call in additional payments (additional contributions).</align>
<align>Additional contributions shall be paid in proportion to the shares.</align>
<align>The articles of association may restrict the obligation to pay an additional contribution to a certain amount to be determined in proportion to the shares.</align>
<align>Section 27 Unlimited obligation to pay additional contributions</align>
<align>If the obligation to pay an additional contribution is not limited to a specified amount, each shareholder, if he has paid the capital share in full, shall have the right to be exempt from payment of the additional contribution called in on the share by making the share available to the company within one month after the call to make the payment in order to satisfy the request to pay the additional contribution.</align>
<align>Likewise, if the shareholders have neither availed themselves of the above-mentioned power nor made the payment within the aforementioned period, the company may declare by registered letter that it regards the share to be at the company’s disposal.</align>
<align>The company shall have the share sold at public auction within one month after the shareholder’s or the company’s declaration has been made.</align>
<align>Any other form of sale shall be permissible only with the consent of the shareholder.</align>
<align>The shareholder shall be entitled to any profits remaining after the costs of sale and the outstanding additional contribution have been covered.</align>
<align>If the company cannot be satisfied by the sale, the share shall fall to the company.</align>
<align>The company shall be authorised to sell the share for its own account.</align>
<align>The articles of association may restrict the application of the foregoing provisions to cases where the additional payments called in on the share exceed a specific amount.</align>
<align>Section 28 Limited obligation to pay additional contributions</align>
<align>If the obligation to pay an additional contribution is limited to a specific amount and the articles of association do not provide otherwise, in the event of delayed payment of additional contributions the provisions set out in sections 21 to 23 in respect of the payment of capital shares shall apply mutatis mutandis.</align>
<align>The same shall also apply in the case referred to in section 27 (4) in the case of an unlimited obligation to pay an additional contribution if the additional contributions do not exceed the amount set out in the articles of association.</align>
<align>The articles of association may stipulate that a request for payment of additional contributions to which the provisions set out in sections 21 to 23 apply shall be permissible even before payment of the capital shares has been fully collected.</align>
<align>Section 29 Appropriation of earnings</align>
<align>The shareholders shall have a claim to the annual surplus plus any profit carried forward and minus any losses carried forward in so far as the resulting amount is not excluded from distribution amongst the shareholders by law or the articles of association, by decision in accordance with subsection (2) or as additional expenses on the basis of the decision concerning the appropriation of earnings.</align>
<align>If the balance sheet is prepared taking account of the partial appropriation of the earnings or if reserves are released, the shareholders shall, in derogation of the first sentence, have a claim to the net earnings shown in the balance sheet.</align>
<align>Unless the articles of association provide otherwise, the shareholders may allot the amounts to retained earnings or carry them forward as profit on the basis of a resolution to appropriate earnings.</align>
<align>The profit shall be distributed in proportion to the shares.</align>
<align>The articles of association may stipulate another criterion for distribution.</align>
<align>Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) and deviating agreements regarding profit distribution in accordance with subsection (3), second sentence, the directors may, with the consent of the supervisory board or the shareholders, allocate to other retained earnings the capital share of those appreciations in value of fixed and current assets.</align>
<align>The amount of these reserves must be entered separately in the balance sheet; it may also be stated in the annex.</align>
<align>Section 30 Capital maintenance</align>
<align>The assets which the company requires to maintain its share capital may not be paid out to the shareholders.</align>
<align>The first sentence shall not apply to payments made upon the existence of a control or profit transfer agreement (section 291 of the Stock Corporation Act) or to payments which are covered by a full claim to counterperformance or restitution against the shareholder.</align>
<align>The first sentence shall also not be applicable to the repayment of a shareholder loan and payments against claims arising from legal acts which correspond economically to a shareholder loan.</align>
<align>If they are not needed to cover a loss in share capital, any paid in additional contributions may be repaid to the shareholders.</align>
<align>The repayment may not be made before three months have elapsed since the decision to make the repayment was made known in accordance with section 12.</align>
<align>In the case referred to in section 28 (2), repayment of additional contributions shall be inadmissible before the share capital has been deposited in full.</align>
<align>Repaid additional contributions shall be deemed not to have been collected.</align>
<align>Section 31Reimbursement of prohibited repayments</align>
<align>Payments which have been made in contravention of the provisions set out in section 30 must be reimbursed to the company.</align>
<align>If the recipient was acting in good faith, reimbursement may only be requested in so far as it is necessary to satisfy the company’s creditors.</align>
<align>If the reimbursement cannot be collected from the recipient, the remaining shareholders shall be liable, in proportion to their shares, for the amount to be reimbursed, in so far as it is necessary to satisfy the company’s creditors.</align>
<align>Amounts which cannot be collected from individual shareholders shall be distributed across the remaining shareholders in the same proportion referred to in the above.</align>
<align>Those obligated to make payments on the basis of the above provisions may not be released from these obligations.</align>
<align>The company’s claims in thecasesreferred toin subsection(1) shall become statute-barred after ten years and in thecasesreferred toin subsection(3) after five years.</align>

<align>The provisions set out in section 43 (1) and (4) shall apply mutatis mutandis.</align>
<align>Section 32 Repayment of profit</align>
<align>If the condition set out in section 31 (1) is not met, the shareholders shall on no account be obligated to repay amounts which they obtained as profit shares in good faith.</align>
<align>Section 32a (repealed)</align>
<align>Section 32b (repealed)</align>
<align>Section 33 Purchase of own shares</align>
<align>The company may not purchase or take in pledge own shares for which the capital contributions have not yet been paid in full.</align>

<align>The rights arising from a new share, including the right to issuance of a certificate on the new share, may be exercised only if partial rights which together amount to a full share are held by a single shareholder or if several entitled persons whose partial rights together amount to a full share jointly exercise their rights (section 18).</align>
<align>Section 57l Participation in increase in share capital</align>
<align>Own shares shall participate in the increase in the share capital.</align>
<align>Partially paid in shares shall participate in the increase in the share capital in accordance with their nominal value.</align>
<align>In such cases the capital increase may only be effected by increasing the nominal value of the shares.</align>
<align>If fully paid in shares exist alongside partially paid in shares, then in their case the capital increase may be effected by increasing the nominal value of the shares and by creating new shares.</align>
<align>The shares whose nominal value is increased may be issued in any full euro amount.</align>
<align>Section 57m Relation between rights; relationships to third parties</align>
<align>The relation between the rights associated with the shares shall not be affected by the capital increase.</align>
<align>Where individual rights of shares which have been partially paid in, in particular any profit sharing or voting rights, are determined by the capital contribution paid per share, these rights shall be accorded to the shareholders up until the outstanding capital contributions have been paid only in the amount of the capital contributions which have been paid in plus the percentage of the increase in the share capital added to the nominal value of the share capital.</align>
<align>If further payments are made, these rights shall increase accordingly.</align>
<align>The economic content of the contractual relationships between the company and third parties which are dependent on the company’s distribution of profits, the nominal value or the value of their shares or share capital or are dependent in another way on the previous capital and earnings ratios shall not be affected by the capital increase.</align>
<align>Section 57n Profit share of new shares</align>
<align>Unless otherwise provided, the new shares shall participate in the profit accruing across the entire financial year in which the resolution to increase the share capital was passed.</align>
<align>The resolution to increase the share capital may stipulate that the new shares already participate in the profit accruing across the last complete financial year before the capital increase resolution was passed.</align>
<align>In such cases, the increase in the share capital shall be decided, in derogation of section 57c (2), before a decision is taken regarding the appropriation of earnings for the last complete financial year before the resolution was passed.</align>
<align>The resolution to appropriate earnings for the last complete financial year before the capital increase resolution was passed does not become effective until the share capital has been increased.</align>
<align>The resolution to increase the share capital and the resolution to appropriate earnings for the last complete financial year before the capital increase resolution was passed shall be null and void if the capital increase resolution is not entered in the Commercial Register within three months after it is passed; this period shall be suspended whilst an action for avoidance or annulment is pending.</align>
<align>Section 57o Purchase costs</align>
<align>The purchase costs of the shares acquired before the increase in the share capital and of the new shares allotted to them shall be deemed to be the amounts resulting for the individual shares if the purchase costs of the shares acquired before the increase in the share capital are distributed across them and the new shares allotted to them in the same proportion as the nominal values.</align>
<align>The increase in shares shall not be accounted for as receipts.</align>
<align>Section 58 Reduction in share capital</align>
<align>A reduction in the share capital may be effected only if the following provisions are observed:</align>
<align>The directors must give notification of the resolution to reduce the share capital in the company’s designated publications; in this notification they must also ask the company’s creditors to contact the company; the creditors indicated in the company’s trading books or who are known in another way shall be asked by separate notification to register;</align>
<align>Those creditors who contact the company and do not give their consent to the reduction shall be satisfied or indemnified in respect of the claims asserted;</align>
<align>The application to enter the resolution to reduce the share capital in the Commercial Register shall not be made until one year has elapsed since that day on which the creditors were asked to contact the company via the company’s designated publications;</align>
<align>The notification of the resolution shall be enclosed with the application; the directors must also give the assurance that those creditors who contacted the company and who have not given their consent to the reduction in the share capital have been satisfied or indemnified.</align>
<align>The provisions set out in section 5 (1) concerning the minimum amount of the share capital shall remain unaffected.</align>
<align>If the reduction is effected for the purpose of repaying capital contributions or for the purpose of remitting those capital contributions which have been deposited, the remaining nominal values of the shares may not fall below the amount designated in section 5 (2) and (3).</align>
<align>Section 58a Simplified capital reduction</align>
<align>Any reduction in the share capital which serves to compensate for depreciations in value or to cover other losses may be effected as a simplified capital reduction.</align>
<align>Simplified capital reduction shall be permissible only after that part of the capital reserves and retained earnings which together exceeds ten per cent of the share capital remaining after the reduction has already been released.</align>
<align>It shall not be permissible whilst there is any profit carryforward.</align>
<align>The resolution on simplified capital reduction shall adapt the nominal values of the shares to the reduced share capital.</align>
<align>The shares must be issued in a full euro amount.</align>
<align>The share capital may be reduced below the minimum nominal value referred to in section 5 (1) if that amount is achieved again by means of a capital increase on which a decision is taken at the same time as the decision on the capital reduction and for which no contributions in kind are determined.</align>
<align>The resolutions shall be null and void if they have not been entered in the Commercial Register within three months of being passed.</align>
<align>This period shall be suspended whilst an action for avoidance or annulment is pending.</align>
<align>The resolutions shall only be jointly entered in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>Sections 58b to 58f shall apply in addition to sections 53 and 54 concerning amendments to the articles of association.</align>
<align>Section 58b Amounts from release of reserves and capital reduction</align>
<align>Amounts deriving from the release of capital reserves or retained earnings and from the capital reduction may be used only to compensate for depreciations in value and other losses.</align>
<align>In addition, the derived amounts may be allocated to the capital reserves in so far as they do not exceed ten per cent of the share capital.</align>
<align>Share capital shall be deemed to be the nominal value which results on account of the reduction, however at least the minimum nominal value permissible in accordance with section 5 (1).</align>
<align>The amount which has been allocated to the capital reserves on the basis of subsection (2) may be used before the end of the fifth financial year which begins after the capital reduction resolution is passed only</align>
<align>to compensate for an annual shortfall in so far as it is not covered by profit carried forward from the previous year and it cannot be compensated by releasing retained earnings;</align>
<align>to compensate for losses carried forward from the previous year in so far as they are not covered by an annual surplus and cannot be compensated by releasing retained earnings;</align>
<align>to increase capital from company funds.</align>
<align>Section 58c Non-occurrence of assumed losses</align>
<align>If it transpires, when preparing the annual balance sheet for the financial year in which the capital reduction resolution was passed or for one of the two subsequent financial years, that depreciations in value and other losses do not actually occur in the amount assumed upon the passing of the resolution or they were compensated for, then the difference shall be allocated to the capital reserves.</align>
<align>Section 58b (3) shall apply mutatis mutandis to an amount allocated to the capital reserves in accordance with the first sentence.</align>
<align>Section 58d Distribution of profits</align>
<align>Profits may be distributed before the end of the fifth financial year which begins after the capital reduction resolution is passed only if the capital reserves and retained earnings together amount to ten per cent of the share capital.</align>
<align>Share capital shall be deemed to be the nominal value resulting from the reduction in capital, at least, however, the minimum nominal value permissible in accordance with section 5 (1).</align>
<align>The payment of a share in the profits of more than four per cent shall be permissible only for a financial year which begins later than two years after the capital reduction resolution is passed.</align>
<align>This shall not apply if those creditors whose claims were established before entry of the resolution was made known are satisfied or indemnified, in so far as they contacted the company in that regard within six months after publication of the annual financial statements on the basis of which a decision on the distribution of profits was taken.</align>
<align>Those creditors need not be satisfied who, in the event of insolvency proceedings being opened, have a right to preferential satisfaction from a state-supervised covering fund created in accordance with a statutory provision for their protection.</align>
<align>Notice given in accordance with section 325 (2) of the Commercial Code shall draw the creditors’ attention to such satisfaction or indemnification.</align>
<align>Section 58e Capital reduction resolution</align>
<align>The annual financial statements for the last complete financial year before the capital reduction resolution was passed may indicate the share capital as well as capital reserves and retained earnings in the amount in which they are to exist after the reduction in the capital.</align>
<align>This shall not apply if the annual financial statements are approved in a manner other than by a resolution of the shareholders.</align>
<align>The resolution to approve the annual financial statements shall be passed at the same time as the capital reduction resolution.</align>
<align>The resolutions shall be null and void if the capital reduction resolution has not been entered in the Commercial Register within three months of being passed.</align>
<align>This period shall be suspended whilst an action for avoidance or annulment is pending.</align>
<align>The annual financial statements may not be disclosed in accordance with section 325 of the Commercial Code until the capital reduction resolution has been entered in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>Section 58f Capital reduction with simultaneous increase in share capital</align>
<align>If, in the case referred to in section 58e, a resolution is passed to increase the share capital at the same time as a decision is taken on capital reduction, account may also be taken in the annual financial statements of the effected capital increase.</align>
<align>The resolution shall be permissible only if the new shares are subscribed to, no contributions in kind are determined and if payment of each of the new shares which must be effected in accordance with section 56a is effected at the filing of the application to enter the capital increase.</align>
<align>Proof of subscription and payment must be furnished to that notary who authenticates the resolution to increase the share capital.</align>
<align>The resolutions shall all be null and void if the resolutions on capital reduction and capital increase have not been entered in the Commercial Register within three months of being passed.</align>
<align>This period shall be suspended whilst an action for avoidance or annulment is pending.</align>
<align>The resolutions shall only be entered jointly in the Commercial Register.</align>
<align>The annual financial statements may not be disclosed in accordance with section 325 of the Commercial Code until the resolutions on capital reduction and capital increase have been entered in the Commercial Register.</align>
